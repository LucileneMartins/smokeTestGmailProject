## ðŸ’¡ Notes About challenge


Hey I would like to say was nice to participate of this challenge  </b></br>
I have to say some hard things i found to automated this feature create account : </b></br>

- It was hard to maintain the zone ( Brazil/USA)
- It was impossible to pass of the phone verirification, this is a good feature that provides to the user
  if i try to automate this in my mind is a litle odd, the reason why google use security feature is to provide security not break her, so in my knoledgment in a project we can work with feature flags , controll environment, and control Data when the telephone and code verification is being expected ( mock on code)
- In a Agile Team, i'm not working with the Test plan, was litle hard to built this documentation but i tried to do my best
